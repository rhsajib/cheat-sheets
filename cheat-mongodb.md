### Type 1
MongoDB allows you to query embedded collections within documents using the dot notation to traverse the fields. Here's how you can perform basic queries on embedded collections:

Suppose you have a document structure like this:

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Exampleville",
    "postalCode": "12345"
  }
}
```

And you want to query this document based on the `city` field within the `address` subdocument.

### Find Documents Based on an Embedded Field

To find documents based on an embedded field, you can use the dot notation:

```javascript
db.collection.find({"address.city": "Exampleville"});
```

This query will return all documents where the `address.city` field matches "Exampleville."

### Querying Arrays of Embedded Documents

If you have an array of embedded documents and you want to query them, you can use the dot notation along with array operators like `$elemMatch` to specify conditions on elements within the array.

Suppose you have a document like this:

```json
{
  "_id": 2,
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": 101,
      "product": "Widget",
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "orderId": 102,
      "product": "Gadget",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

And you want to find orders with a quantity greater than 1:

```javascript
db.collection.find({
  "orders": {
    $elemMatch: {
      "quantity": { $gt: 1 }
    }
  }
});
```

This query will return documents where at least one element in the "orders" array has a "quantity" greater than 1.

Remember that MongoDB supports various query operators and aggregation functions to perform more complex queries and transformations on embedded documents within arrays or subdocuments. 


### Type 2

If you want to query all the `quantity` values from the "orders" array across multiple documents in another collection, you can use MongoDB's aggregation framework to achieve this. Specifically, you can use the `$unwind` and `$group` stages to first flatten the arrays and then group the results to extract the quantities.

Suppose you have a collection called `users` with documents like this:

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": 101,
      "product": "Widget",
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "orderId": 102,
      "product": "Gadget",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Here's how you can query all the `quantity` values from the "orders" array across all documents:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $unwind: "$orders" // Flatten the "orders" array
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      allQuantities: { $push: "$orders.quantity" } // Create an array of all quantities
    }
  }
]);
```

In this aggregation:

1. The `$unwind` stage is used to flatten the "orders" array, creating multiple documents for each order.

2. The `$group` stage groups the documents into a single group (with `_id: null`) and creates an array `allQuantities` that contains all the `quantity` values from the flattened documents.

After running this aggregation, you will get a result that looks like this:

```json
{
  "_id": null,
  "allQuantities": [2, 1, ...] // An array of all quantities
}
```

This result will contain an array with all the `quantity` values from the "orders" arrays across all documents in the collection.


### Type 3
If you want to retrieve all documents from the "order_ids" collection where the "orderId" exists in any order from the user's "orders" array, you can use the `$lookup` stage to perform this operation. Here's how you can do it:

Suppose you have the "user" document:

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": 101,
      "product": "Widget",
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "orderId": 102,
      "product": "Gadget",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

And you have the "order_ids" collection with documents like this:

```json
[
  {
    "orderId": 101,
    "items": 5
  },
  {
    "orderId": 102,
    "items": 55
  },
  {
    "orderId": 110,
    "items": 19
  }
]
```

You can use the `$lookup` stage to retrieve all documents from the "order_ids" collection that match any "orderId" from the user's "orders" array. Here's the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to achieve this:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      "_id": 1 // Replace with the user's _id or any other identifier
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$orders" // Flatten the "orders" array
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "order_ids",
      localField: "orders.orderId",
      foreignField: "orderId",
      as: "matched_orders"
    }
  }
]);
```

In this aggregation:

1. The `$match` stage filters the "users" collection to find the user with the specified `_id`. Replace `1` with the user's actual `_id` or another identifier.

2. The `$unwind` stage is used to flatten the "orders" array, creating multiple documents for each order.

3. The `$lookup` stage performs a join operation with the "order_ids" collection. It matches the "orderId" from the user's "orders" array (`localField`) with the "orderId" in the "order_ids" collection (`foreignField`). The result is stored in the "matched_orders" field.

After running this aggregation, the "matched_orders" field will contain an array of documents from the "order_ids" collection that match any "orderId" from the user's "orders" array. The result will include all orders that match across all "orderId" values in the user's "orders" array.

### Type 4

To add or update documents in a separate "order_ids" collection based on the "orders" array within your "user" document, you can use the MongoDB aggregation framework along with the `$merge` stage to perform the operation.

Here's how you can achieve this:

Suppose you have the "user" document:

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": 101,
      "product": "Widget",
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "orderId": 102,
      "product": "Gadget",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

And you want to update the "order_ids" collection like this:

```json
[
  {
    "orderId": 101,
    "items": 5
  },
  {
    "orderId": 102,
    "items": 55
  },
  {
    "orderId": 110,
    "items": 19
  }
]
```

You can use the following MongoDB aggregation pipeline to achieve this:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $unwind: "$orders" // Flatten the "orders" array
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      orderId: "$orders.orderId",
      items: "$orders.quantity"
    }
  },
  {
    $merge: {
      into: "order_ids", // Destination collection
      whenMatched: "merge", // If the document already exists in the destination collection, merge it
      whenNotMatched: "insert" // If the document doesn't exist in the destination collection, insert it
    }
  }
]);
```

In this aggregation:

1. The `$unwind` stage is used to flatten the "orders" array, creating multiple documents for each order.

2. The `$project` stage is used to reshape the document to extract the "orderId" and "quantity" fields, renaming them to "orderId" and "items."

3. The `$merge` stage is used to merge the transformed documents into the "order_ids" collection. If a document with the same "orderId" exists, it will be updated; otherwise, it will be inserted.

After running this aggregation, the "order_ids" collection will be updated with the desired order IDs and their corresponding quantities based on the "orders" array in the "user" document.
